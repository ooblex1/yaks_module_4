    <h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

<ul>
  <li>for students to identify how they can help improve their own learning</li>
  <li>for students to identify how they can help their group learn</li>
  <li>for the professor to identify how he can help students learn</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="activity">Activity</h2>

<p>We discuss the feedback from the mid-term survey conducted by DCAL and the Instructional team.
Below are a few of the themes that came through loud and clear:</p>

<h3 id="things-we-do-well">Things we do well</h3>

<ul>
  <li>we compliment each other; we respect each other</li>
  <li>we <em>work together</em> to <em>learn together</em></li>
  <li>we all contribute to understanding the task, understanding the material, and devising a solution</li>
  <li>we rotate partners and the ‘point person’ on activities</li>
  <li>we explain difficult concepts to others in our group</li>
  <li>we ask each other questions when we need help</li>
  <li>we ask questions to help guide others toward understanding</li>
  <li>we ask our Learning Fellow when we get stuck</li>
  <li>where we have different levels of experience, the more-experienced help the less-experienced.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="things-students-can-do">Things students can do</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I can pay more attention in lecture, and be ready to engage with the group activity</li>
  <li>I can attend regularly - and be part of my group</li>
  <li>I can participate more in my group activity</li>
  <li>I can encourage my group to work together rather than independently</li>
  <li>I can encourage each member to actively contribute</li>
  <li>I can rotate partners with whom I work</li>
  <li>I can encourage my group to rotate the ‘point person’ on activities</li>
  <li>I can ask more questions to help others understand the activity or the material</li>
  <li>I can make sure everyone’s voice is heard</li>
  <li>I can create a groupme, slack, or other chat group to encourage group communication outside class</li>
  <li>I can get to know my team better - get together outside class</li>
  <li>I can read the lecture notes and labs more carefully</li>
  <li>I can help everyone by contributing answers on Piazza</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="things-the-professor-can-do">Things the professor can do</h3>

<ul>
  <li>he can clarify opportunities for help outside class</li>
  <li>he can vary how he conveys concepts in lecture: whiteboard work, live-coding programs, finished programs, in-class activities</li>
  <li>he can choose better (more interesting) examples</li>
  <li>he can explain pointers more clearly</li>
  <li>he can <em>slow down</em> the pace</li>
  <li>he can <em>speed up</em> the pace</li>
  <li>he can spend <em>more</em> time on in-class activities</li>
  <li>he can spend <em>less</em> time on in-class activities</li>
  <li>he can provide solutions to in-class activities</li>
  <li>he can ensure the lectures (and notes) cover everything needed for the labs</li>
  <li>he can streamline the lecture material - avoid ‘lecture extras’</li>
  <li>he can clarify the expectations for each lab</li>
  <li>he can ensure faster turnaround on lab grades/feedback</li>
  <li>he can ensure section leaders are better prepared for sections</li>
  <li>he can reconsider the policies on attendance and assigned seating</li>
  <li>he can reconsider the assigment of groups at start of term</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other-observations">Other observations</h3>

<ul>
  <li>the classroom furniture arrangement is not conducive to lecture</li>
  <li>in-class activities are helpful to some students</li>
  <li>out-of-class coding is how students learn best</li>
</ul>
