<h2 id="introduction-to-debugging">Introduction to debugging</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.
Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.” - Brian Kernighan</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As we have started to turn our attention towards writing larger, more complex C programs we have tried to stress the importance of debugging incorrect or suspicious behavior in programs as well as documenting in detail how those programs have been tested.
The goal in making debugging and testing a priority is building programs in such a way that we are confident that they are robust and correct.</p>

<p>Alas, despite our great intentions to compose quality software, bugs still find their way into our code.
Bugs are such an inevitablity in fact that many people have tried to estimate the number of bugs per some number of lines of code (LoC).
Some people believe the underlying takeaway is that our code should be as concise/complex as needed so that we can have fewer lines of code.
In this class, however, we take the stance that everyone should write clear code and should avoid the use of overly complex code because this can result in code that is <em>extremely</em> difficult to debug when those inevitable bugs crop up.
The words of Brian Kernighan (above) ring loud and clear on this topic.</p>

<p>In this lecture we will take a look at a couple of popular tools that are used for debugging C programs.
In a later lecture we will focus more on various approaches to testing.</p>

<p>Feel free to skip these notes if you write perfect, bug free code ;-)</p>

<h2 id="techniques-for-limiting-those-pesky-bugs">Techniques for limiting those pesky bugs</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Don’t Panic” – Hitchiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The trouble with bugs is that no two are the same.
Bugs can be simple: bad pointers and array subscript errors; while others are sometime difficult to debug: the systems might run for days and then fail because of a slow memory leak or numeric overflow problem.</p>

<p>Programmers aim to understand the nature of the bug they are trying to swat: <em>is it reproducible?</em>
(does it always fail under the same set of conditions), <em>does it always manifest itself in the same way?</em>, and so on.
Some bugs are particularly hard to find, like a  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug">Heisenbug</a> which</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>seems to disappear or alter its behavior when one attempts to study it.
An example of a Heisenbug is one that is related to the current mix of processes running at the same time as the program being studied.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are clues that help track down those pesky bugs in complex systems.
To some degree being a good debugger of C code comes with experience.</p>

<p>By now you are used to segfaults and seeing files such as core dumps in your directory when you run your program and something goes wrong (unless your are writing/compiling/running programs on the CS machines—there are details near the end of this lecture about accessing and debugging core files on the CS machines).
You may have heard others mention tools like the the GNU debugger (<code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code>) and Valgrind (<code class="highlighter-rouge">valgrind</code>)—or even have some experience using these tools yourself— which can be an invaluable aid in solving problems.
Through a set of examples we will show how to debug problems in a systematic manner.
But first let’s discuss why bugs occur and what technques other than running <code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code> help.</p>

<p>The complexity of a program is related to the number of interacting components; for example, the crawler interacts with the external <code class="highlighter-rouge">libcurl</code> library.
There is a line of thought that says as a rule of thumb the number of bugs grows with the number of interactions.
Reducing the complexity and interactions enables us to focus in on the location of bugs in code.
Gordon Bell summed it up this way:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The cheapest, fastest, and most reliable components of a computer system are the ones that aren’t there.”
 – <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gbell/">Gordon Bell</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gordon’s point is that the importance of a simple design cannot be overemphasized.</p>

<p>Debugging problems ranges from easy, moderate, or even all the way through downright super hard.
Techniques that help reduce degugging time include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>a good design and design methodology;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>consistent style (e.g., use C program idioms as much as possible);</strong></li>
  <li><strong>boundary condition tests;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>assertions and sanity testing;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>defensive programming;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>designing for testing;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>avoid files that have a large number of functions, and functions that have a large number of lines; Aim for functions that do one thing, and do it well!</strong></li>
  <li><strong>limit global data whenever possible; and</strong></li>
  <li><strong>leverage desk checking tools.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>While we’ve already discussed some of these topics in this course, we will discuss more of them in this lecture and in future lectures.</p>

<h2 id="approaches-to-debugging">Approaches to debugging</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.<br />
– Unknown</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When tracking down pesky bugs we can think of the following steps to finding and correcting them—a sort of “bug lifecycle”:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Finding out what bugs exist.
We have already designed some simple tests for programs we’ve written in this class already.
In a future lecture we will look at more approaches to testing.</li>
  <li><strong>Stabilization:</strong> Try and make the bugs reproducible (identify the conditions that cause a particular bug every time).</li>
  <li><strong>Localization:</strong> Identify the function/line of the code responsible.
If it repeated anywhere, then <em>refactor</em> the code.
    <ul>
      <li>“Refactor” means clean it up, reorganize it, improve readability/testability, etc., all without changing the code’s behavior.</li>
      <li>Be sure to run unit tests before and after refactoring to ensure you “did no harm.”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Correction:</strong> Fix the code!</li>
  <li><strong>Verification:</strong> Test the code fix and confirm it works.
Then imagine other boundary-case examples that are related to the one that caused this bug to occur and test those while you’re here.</li>
</ul>

<p>Even in light of the above mentioned steps to finding and correcting bugs, there are many ways that people approach debugging their programs when issues arise…</p>

<ul>
  <li>They don’t.</li>
  <li>They sift through warning/error messages; once all of the messages are gone, they assume their program is correct.</li>
  <li>They use <code class="highlighter-rouge">printf</code>-style debugging (i.e., use <code class="highlighter-rouge">printf</code> statements strategically placed throughout code to help with inspection of variables and control flow).</li>
  <li>They use a specialized debugging tools/programs (e.g., plugins integrated into your favorite IDE, commandline tools like <code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">valgrind</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>We hope it is clear that <em>not</em> debugging is a bad idea.
Eliminating all of the warnings and errors is a good idea (and indeed is required when submitting assignments in cs50 :) but without proper testing there is no guarantee that your program is correct does what you think it should do.
In the following sections we will discuss some of the other approaches to debugging.</p>

<h3 id="code-inspection">Code Inspection</h3>

<p>Many times people rush and “hack” the debug phase and sit at the terminal hoping to eventually track down that bug via trial and error.
Most people do this as their first resort.
You will find this approach can be successful but it can be very time consuming - put more plainly, it will take longer than other techniques.</p>

<p><strong><em>One of the most effective debug tools is you!</em></strong> Stop and read your code.
Pretend you are a computer and execute the code with a pen and paper.
As you read your code, keep some of the following tips in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Draw diagrams! Especially for data structures.</li>
  <li>Regarding for/while loops, and recursion, think about the base case, and the boundary conditions, and work inductively toward the general case.
Errors most often occur at the base case or at the boundary cases.</li>
</ul>

<p>Code inspection is very useful.
Good programmers closely trace through their code in detail.
Look for boundary problems in code, many times bugs exist at the boundaries - of structures, arrays, code (e.g., for loops), and, most of all, data.
Many difficult bugs require more power than just hacking and hoping.
Once you have read your code and convinced yourself it works then bugs remain you need to instrument your code and start the detective work.</p>

<p>Sometimes while debugging you will discover other, unrelated bugs that haven’t yet manifested themselves.
FIX THEM!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Fix the Problem, Not the Blame</strong>

</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-printf-approach-to-debugging">The <code class="highlighter-rouge">printf</code> approach to debugging</h2>

<p>“All I need is <code class="highlighter-rouge">printf</code>, right?”</p>

<p>Up until now you have been using mostly <code class="highlighter-rouge">printf()</code> (or its variants) to help you debug your code.
That can only get you so far.
Many different types of errors or bugs can exist in software.
For example, you may have bug free code but the performance of the system is abysmal.
How do you find performance errors in your code - could it be the choice of data structure is too “slow”, the structure of your code is awful, or perhaps the algorithms are a bad match for the system hardware or a particular set of input data?
What happens if you code looks error free but you have memory leaks?
You’ll get little help from <code class="highlighter-rouge">printf()</code> for these.</p>

<p>Worse, the underlying bug may even interfere with <code class="highlighter-rouge">printf()</code>’s limited contribution to your efforts.
For example, if you have a segfault that occurs after your <code class="highlighter-rouge">printf()</code> is executed but its string never gets displayed because the process seg faults—you might think that the bug occurs before your <code class="highlighter-rouge">printf</code> when really the bug happens much later.
The takeaway here is that <code class="highlighter-rouge">printf</code> is not your friend in these examples, rather it’s a red herring.
What happens if your system runs for hours and only under a certain set of system conditions the code fails.
Working your way through 1000s of <code class="highlighter-rouge">printf</code> statements may not help.
When a bug is buried deep in the execution of your software you need sophisticated tools to track those down.
You need more than <code class="highlighter-rouge">printf()</code> to attack these bugs.
This lecture talks about tools to help with performance issues, memory leaks and difficult bugs.</p>

<p>One more thing about using <code class="highlighter-rouge">printf()</code> for debugging.  Just because <code class="highlighter-rouge">stdout</code> shows some of your <code class="highlighter-rouge">printf()</code>s were executed doesn’t always mean that the last message written to <code class="highlighter-rouge">stdout</code> is from the last <code class="highlighter-rouge">printf()</code> before the program had a problem.  Unix output is often <em>lazy</em>, meaning that the system will <em>eventually</em> send the message to <code class="highlighter-rouge">stdout</code> but only when it is ready (e.g., some minimum number of characters to print to make it worthwhile, when the system is doing output for your process as well as others, etc.).
This may seem unimportant, but it means that your program <em>may execute the code following the <code class="highlighter-rouge">printf()</code> before the output appears</em>. So, 
if you are using <code class="highlighter-rouge">printf()</code> for debugging, you should follow it with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">fflush(stdout)</code> which tells the system “print it NOW” before your program continues.  Some will define a C preprocessor macro for this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-C">/* debugMacros.c - in the examples directory */
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

#define DEBUGMSG(s)  { printf("DEBUG: %s",s); fflush(stdout);}

/* In gcc and other modern compilers you can define */
/* the macro to use a variable number of arguments */
#define EPRINTF(...)  fprintf (stderr, __VA_ARGS__)

int main()
{
    DEBUGMSG("Entered main\n");
    int rc=42, b=2;
    float a=1., c=3.14159;

    if (rc)  {
      EPRINTF("Badness abounds! rc=%d \n", rc);
      EPRINTF("Say something else ... ");
      EPRINTF("and then a bit more: %f, %d, %f .\n", a, b, c);
    }
    printf("bye!");
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="the-gnu-debugger-gdb">The GNU Debugger (GDB)</h2>

<p>To get started type <code class="highlighter-rouge">man gdb</code> at the command line.
The web also has good information on <code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code>: for a detailed article check out: <a href="http://ace.cs.ohiou.edu/morton/docs/gdb_manual/gdb.html">the GDB manual</a>.
It should be no surprise that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">emacs</code> editor also supports <code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code> - see <a href="http://tedlab.mit.edu/~dr/gdbintro.html">An Introduction To Using GDB Under Emacs</a>.
When learning a new tool, such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code>, it can be quite helpful to keep a a good <code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code> <a href="http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~adnan/gdb-refcard.pdf">quick reference card</a> handy - all you need to know in terms of command syntax is here.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Before we get started using <code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code>, ensure your <code class="highlighter-rouge">mygcc</code> alias has the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-ggdb</code> flag - our standard <code class="highlighter-rouge">.bashrc</code> file defines <code class="highlighter-rouge">mygcc</code> with this flag.
This flag ensures that useful metadata is packaged with your executable at compile time that <code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code> needs to help you debug your programs.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">alias </span>mygcc

</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> For the curious student, it is also worth noting that you can use GDB to debug programs written not only in C but also in C++, FORTRAN, and Modula-2.</p>

<p>The gdb debugger is invoked with the shell command <code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code>; it then prints its own prompt and accepts its own wide range of commands.
Once started, it reads commands from the terminal until you tell it to exit with the gdb command <code class="highlighter-rouge">quit</code>.
You can get online help from <code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code> itself by using the command <code class="highlighter-rouge">help</code>.</p>

<h3 id="gdb-demo">GDB Demo</h3>

<p>In the following examples we will use a lot of the basic <code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code> commands - <code class="highlighter-rouge">break</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">run</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">next</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">step</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">continue</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">display</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">printf</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> (examine memory), <code class="highlighter-rouge">backtrace</code> (<code class="highlighter-rouge">bt</code> for short), and <code class="highlighter-rouge">frame</code> ( <a href="http://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Frames.html">checkout stack frames</a>- this is an important concept in C and very useful for debugging and poking around in your code and looking at variables).
These are most of the common commands.</p>

<p>I strongly recommend that you go through the sequence of steps below and use these debugging commands.
Don’t worry, you can’t break anything.
Just like the shell commands you’ll only need a subset of the the complete set of <code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code> commands to become a very effective debugger.
Again, <code class="highlighter-rouge">printf</code> is for novices and not part of the hacker’s parlance or the necessary tools in your toolkit: <code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code> is!</p>

<p>Let’s start by <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd</code>‘ing to the directory where we have some program that we want to debug—for the purpose of this demo I will be using a new “password” program.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/cs50-live/password
<span class="nv">$ </span>make
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The program is simple: “password” simulates a program that prompts the user to enter their password.
If the user’s “guess” matches the password, then the user is “authenticated” (i.e., they get the nice “success” message).
If the user fails to enter the correct password, they will be prompted again.
The user is only allowed 3 guesses before the program terminates.</p>

<p>I tried the program once where I entered the correct password (which is currently hardcoded into the program) and successfully “authenticated.” I also tried the program on some reasonable “guess” passwords and I wasn’t able to authenticate.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ ./password
password: cs50
success!

$ ./password
password: password
incorrect. try again. (attempt 1)
password: dartmouth
incorrect. try again. (attempt 2)
password: passwd
incorrect. try again. (attempt 3)
you've exceeded the max. number of attempts. try again later.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So I’m good, right?!</p>

<p>Well, except for this weird thing I encountered.
I thought I’d test the program with a few more passwords that that I thought of:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ ./password
password:
incorrect. try again. (attempt 1)
password: 2345
incorrect. try again. (attempt 2)
password: abcdefghijklmn
success!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>WHAT?! Success? Really?</p>

<p>OK, let’s poke at this a little more:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ ./password
password: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Uh oh.
The dreaded segfault.
OK, I need to investigate more.
Clearly something funny happens when I start entering long passwords (that or this program really doesn’t like the alphabet…).
Since the weird behavior I’m noticing seems to be related to reading/checking passwords that are entered, I’ll start my investigation of the code there.</p>

<p>Let’s try running our program in that cool debugging tool, <code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code>.
When <code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code> starts up it prints out a bunch of information about its version and license, then drops into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code> “shell.”</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ gdb password
GNU gdb (GDB) Fedora 7.10.1-31.fc23
Copyright (C) 2015 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
...(snipped)...
Reading symbols from password...done.
(gdb)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One of the powerful features that a debugger offers us is the ability to set “breakpoints” in our code; when we run our program and the debugger encounters a breakpoint that we previously set, the execution of the program stops at that point.
Let’s set a few breakpoints:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(gdb) break main
Breakpoint 1 at 0x400805: file password.c, line 22.
(gdb) break check_password
Breakpoint 2 at 0x4008b4: file password.c, line 57.
(gdb) break 36
Breakpoint 3 at 0x40086a: file password.c, line 36.
(gdb) info break
Num     Type           Disp Enb Address            What
1       breakpoint     keep y   0x0000000000400805 in main at password.c:22
2       breakpoint     keep y   0x00000000004008b4 in check_password at password.c:57
3       breakpoint     keep y   0x000000000040086a in main at password.c:36
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hopefully you caught that: notice that we can set breakpoints by identifying the name of a function (e.g., “main” and “check_password”), or by specifying a particular line in our source code (e.g., line 36).
There are other identifiers that can be used to enable breakpoints (e.g., by memory address) but we will leave you to explore those later.
When you are debugging programs with multiple files you can also set breakpoints in different files by specifying the file as well as the function name/line of code where you’d like to enable a breakpoint.
Again, we will get familiar with the basics here and you can go explore some of the other cool <code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code> features later.
Anytime you want to see the breakpoints you’ve currently created, run <code class="highlighter-rouge">info break</code> (as shown above).
You can also clear all of your breakpoints (<code class="highlighter-rouge">clear</code>), clear specific breakpoints (<code class="highlighter-rouge">clear function</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">clear line</code>), or even enable/disable breakpoints so that you can leave them in place, but control whether the cause your program to stop when the breakpoint is encountered.
Let’s disable all of our breakpoints except for the one we set at the <code class="highlighter-rouge">check_password</code> function:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(gdb) disable 1 3
(gdb) info break
Num     Type           Disp Enb Address            What
1       breakpoint     keep n   0x0000000000400805 in main at password.c:22
2       breakpoint     keep y   0x00000000004008b4 in check_password at password.c:57
3       breakpoint     keep n   0x000000000040086a in main at password.c:36
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point we’ve started <code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code> and told it about some breakpoints we want set, but we haven’t actually started running our program.
Let’s run our program now:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(gdb) run
Starting program: /net/grad/traviswp/cs50-live/password/password

Breakpoint 2, check_password () at password.c:57
57	    int authenticated = 0;       // "flag" that determines if the user successfully authenticated.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Just as we hoped (expected), the debugger started our program running but “paused” the program as soon as it hit the breakpoint that we set at the <code class="highlighter-rouge">check_password</code> function.
Once the program has stopped we can “poke around” a bit.</p>

<p>Now let’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">step</code> one line of code at a time:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(gdb) step
60	    printf("password: ");
(gdb) step
__printf (format=0x400a9f "password: ") at printf.c:28
28	{
(gdb) step
32	  va_start (arg, format);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Oops! Stepping line by line is nice but <code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code>’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">step</code> command allowed us to walk right down into the icky details of <code class="highlighter-rouge">printf</code>!
This is  pretty cool that we can “step” into functions but <code class="highlighter-rouge">printf</code> does a lot of work that we aren’t interested in right now.
If you find yourself deep down in some function that you accidentally stepped into, use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">finish</code> command to start the program running again until just after the function in the current stack frame returns.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(gdb) finish
Run till exit from #0  __printf (format=0x400a9f "password: ") at printf.c:32
check_password () at password.c:61
61	    if (fgets(guess, 50, stdin) == NULL)
Value returned is $1 = 10
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now that we are back up in our <code class="highlighter-rouge">check_password</code> function we can proceed.
To avoid stepping <em>into</em> functions we can use the alternative <code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code> command called <code class="highlighter-rouge">next</code> which is similar to <code class="highlighter-rouge">step</code> in that it executes one line of code and then pauses at the next line of code, however <code class="highlighter-rouge">next</code> will step <em>over</em> functions so that we don’t end up deep down in some code that isn’t relevant to us (i.e., deep inside of the details of <code class="highlighter-rouge">printf</code>); let’s try that now:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(gdb) next
password: password
65	    if (strlen(guess) == 0)
(gdb) next
71	    if (guess[strlen(guess)-1] != '\n') {
(gdb) next
78	        guess[strlen(guess)-1] = 0;
(gdb) next
82	    if (strcmp(PASSWORD, guess) == 0)
(gdb) next
85	    return authenticated;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When we were using <code class="highlighter-rouge">next</code> (above) we finally got the prompt to enter a password—I decided to try one of the most popular passwords out there: “password” :).</p>

<p>Before we go any further, let’s look at some of the local variables.
We can use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">print</code> command to display the value of some expression (e.g., variable name).</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(gdb) print authenticated
$2 = 0
(gdb) print guess
$3 = "password\000"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can even evaluate C code!</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(gdb) print strlen(guess)
$4 = 8
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or use C’s “address of” operator to learn about where some of our variables live in memory.
Keep in mind that these variables live on the “stack” and are local variables that only exist within the <code class="highlighter-rouge">check_password</code> function.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(gdb) print &amp;authenticated
$5 = (int *) 0x7fffffffdf8c
(gdb) print &amp;guess
$6 = (char (*)[10]) 0x7fffffffdf80
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Pretty cool, right?
Notice that <code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code> is nice enough to also give us information about the <em>type</em> of the thing that we are looking at!</p>

<p>Let’s run <code class="highlighter-rouge">next</code> until we are done in <code class="highlighter-rouge">check_password</code>.
Once we return from <code class="highlighter-rouge">check_password</code> we are returned to <code class="highlighter-rouge">main</code> at the point in the code just after where we called <code class="highlighter-rouge">check_password</code>.
I kind of forget where we are in the code so I’m going to use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">list</code> command to dump out some of the source code around where I am currently stopped in the program’s execution.
By default, <code class="highlighter-rouge">list</code> will show us 10 lines of code where our current line is “centered” in the output.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(gdb) next
86	}
(gdb) next
main (argc=1, argv=0x7fffffffe0a8) at password.c:38
38	        n_guesses++;
(gdb) list
33
34	    // get password and check if user authenticated
35	    int result;
36	    while (n_guesses &lt; MAX_NUM_GUESSES) {
37	        result = check_password();
38	        n_guesses++;
39	        if (result)
40	            break;
41	        else
42	            printf("(%d) incorrect. try again. (attempt %d)\n", result, n_guesses);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Back to stepping and checking some variables…and trying another password…</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(gdb) step
39	        if (result)
(gdb) step
42	            printf("(%d) incorrect. try again. (attempt %d)\n", result, n_guesses);
(gdb) step
__printf (format=0x400a28 "(%d) incorrect. try again. (attempt %d)\n") at printf.c:28
28	{
(gdb) finish
Run till exit from #0  __printf (format=0x400a28 "(%d) incorrect. try again. (attempt %d)\n") at printf.c:28
(0) incorrect. try again. (attempt 1)
main (argc=1, argv=0x7fffffffe0a8) at password.c:36
36	    while (n_guesses &lt; MAX_NUM_GUESSES) {
Value returned is $7 = 38
(gdb) next
37	        result = check_password();
(gdb) next

Breakpoint 2, check_password () at password.c:57
57	    int authenticated = 0;       // "flag" that determines if the user successfully authenticated.
(gdb) next
60	    printf("password: ");
(gdb) next
61	    if (fgets(guess, 50, stdin) == NULL)
(gdb) next
password: password2
65	    if (strlen(guess) == 0)
(gdb) print guess
$8 = "password2\n"
(gdb) print authenticated
$9 = 0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>OK, I’m getting tired of stepping.
Rather than stepping line by line, I want to start the program running again (at least until it hits the breakpoint again) so that I can speed up the process getting back to the code where I can enter a password and verify the changes.
To do this I can simply use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">continue</code> command which will continue the execution of the program until it is stopped again for some reason.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(gdb) continue
Continuing.
(0) incorrect. try again. (attempt 2)

Breakpoint 2, check_password () at password.c:57
57	    int authenticated = 0;       // "flag" that determines if the user successfully authenticated.
(gdb) next
60	    printf("password: ");
(gdb)
61	    if (fgets(guess, 50, stdin) == NULL)
(gdb)
password: password1234
65	    if (strlen(guess) == 0)
(gdb) c
Continuing.
(0) incorrect. try again. (attempt 3)
you've exceeded the max. number of attempts. try again later.
[Inferior 1 (process 16748) exited with code 02]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It looks like we got booted from the program because we exceeded the maximum number of attempts that it will allow.</p>

<p>At this point we’ve seen some useful <code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code> commands and you are now equipped to do some debugging on your own.
Keep poking at the program and see if you can find the error that allows people to authenticate in cases where they really shouldn’t be allowed to do so.
If you need a push in the right direction, check out this <a href="passwordhint.html">hint</a>.
If you really can’t figure it out after trying to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code>, you can also check out a <a href="passwordsolution.html">brief discussion for the solution</a> to the bug—only do this if you’ve <em>really</em> given it the ol’ college try though :)</p>

<p><strong>A couple of cool things to note about <code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code> at this point:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Everytime you enter a command at the <code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code> “shell” that is successful, the output value is stored in a variable denoted <code class="highlighter-rouge">$N</code> where <code class="highlighter-rouge">N</code> increments by 1 for each command that you run.
You can use those variables at a later point if you want (e.g., <code class="highlighter-rouge">print $3</code>).</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code> supports auto-completion on function names and variable names! Go ahead and try it out!</li>
  <li>Also similar to the regular shell, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code> shell allows you to arrow up/down to revisit past commands.</li>
  <li>Many of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code> commands have abbreviated forms (e.g., <code class="highlighter-rouge">run</code>=&gt;<code class="highlighter-rouge">r</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">continue</code>=&gt;<code class="highlighter-rouge">c</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">next</code>=&gt;<code class="highlighter-rouge">n</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">backtrace</code>=&gt;<code class="highlighter-rouge">bt</code>); see the <a href="http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~adnan/gdb-refcard.pdf">gdb quick reference guide</a> to see other commands that have abbreviated forms.</li>
  <li>You can actually re-run the previous command simply by hitting <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;enter&gt;</code>.</li>

<h2 id="valgrind-a-memory-management-profiling-tool">Valgrind: a memory management profiling tool</h2>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">valgrind</code> tool is excellent for finding a number of problems, specifically issues in programs that involve illegal memory access and memory leaks.
Be sure to read this excellent brief tutorial from Stanford’s CS107 class: <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs107/guide_valgrind.html">Guide to Valgrind</a> (some of the notes below are adapted from this guide).</p>

<p>Running a program under <code class="highlighter-rouge">valgrind</code> results in extensive checking of memory allocations and accesses and it provides a report with detailed information about the context and circumstances of each error.
The output report can be quite verbose and a little difficult to use to improve your program’s usage of memory if you don’t know what you are looking for; therefore one of our objectives here is to look at a couple of examples and start to get a handle on how to read and interpret <code class="highlighter-rouge">valgrind</code>’s output.</p>

<p><strong>=&gt; The Goal of a Programmer:</strong> A clean report from <code class="highlighter-rouge">valgrind</code> that indicates “no errors and no leaks.”</p>

<p>As far as you are concerned when using <code class="highlighter-rouge">valgrind</code>, there are two general types of feedback you will get regarding your program’s usage of memory.
We will look at these next.</p>

<h3 id="memory-errors">Memory errors</h3>

<p>The really obvious and bad memory errors will crash your program outright (e.g., accessing memory that is outside of your program’s allocated memory).
The not so obvious memory related errors may “get lucky” most of the time (i.e., touch valid memory), but every once in a while the luck runs out and your program, somewhat mysteriously, fails.
Running <code class="highlighter-rouge">valgrind</code> on your program can give you insightful information on both of these sorts of errors.</p>

<p>When an error is detected by <code class="highlighter-rouge">valgrind</code> you should see some output that includes some sort of error description, the offending source code (line), and a little bit of information about the actual memory and what may be going wrong.
There are a few different types of memory errors that you may see such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Invalid read/write of size X</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Use of uninitialized value</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">Conditional jump or move depends on unitialized value(s)</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Source and destination overlap in memcpy()</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Invalid free()</code></li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="memory-leaks">Memory “leaks”</h3>

<p>When you allocate memory (e.g., <code class="highlighter-rouge">malloc</code>) but fail to properly <code class="highlighter-rouge">free</code> that memory when it is no longer needed, this leads to what is known as a <em>memory leak</em>.</p>

<p>As we’ve seen in class, memory leaks in small, short-lived programs that exit fairly quickly don’t cause any noticable issues.
In larger projects that operate on lots of data and/or those that are intended to run for a long time (e.g., webservers), memory leaks can add up quickly and cause your program to fail.</p>

<p>Valgrind allows you to check your programs (e.g., <code class="highlighter-rouge">prog</code>) for memory leaks and to get the best feedback you’ll want to specify some additional flags:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>valgrind <span class="nt">--leak-check</span><span class="o">=</span>full <span class="nt">--show-leak-kinds</span><span class="o">=</span>all ./prog <span class="o">[</span>ARGS]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For convenience, we’ve actually defined a nice myvalgrind alias in the cs50 bashrc file for just this reason.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">alias </span>myvalgrind
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Thus, you can simply run:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>myvalgrind ./prog <span class="o">[</span>ARGS]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The easiest way to determine if there is some sort of memory leak is to check the alloc/free counts generated in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">valgrind</code> output.
Ideally, the counts should match.
If they don’t you’ll get a “LEAK SUMMARY” at the end of the report as well as a little bit of information from <code class="highlighter-rouge">valgrind</code> regarding each of the detected memory leaks (e.g., how many bytes were leaked, where in the code the allocation happened).</p>

<p>When profiling your program, <code class="highlighter-rouge">valgrind</code> will attempt to categorize any memory leaks into one of four categories: <strong>(1) definitely lost:</strong> memory that was allocated from the heap but not properly freed, and there is no longer a pointer to the data; <strong>(2) indirectly lost:</strong> memory allocated from the heap that was indirectly lost due to “losing” a pointer that provided access to other heap-allocated memory; <strong>(3) possibly lost:</strong> memory that was allocated from the heap but not properly freed—<code class="highlighter-rouge">valgrind</code> can’t determine whether or not there is a pointer to the memory; <strong>(4) still reachable:</strong> memory that was allocated from the heap but not properly freed, but the program still retains a pointer to the memory in some way.
Regardless of the category, these are all considered memory leaks and should be fixed!</p>

<h3 id="valgrind-demos">Valgrind Demos</h3>

<p>In class we looked at one of the more recent versions of the “names” program, <code class="highlighter-rouge">names9</code>.
Running <code class="highlighter-rouge">valgrind</code> by itself does a good job of identifying various types of <em>memory errors</em> (see above).
If we want, however, to also get information about <em>memory leaks</em> in our programs, we need to run <code class="highlighter-rouge">valgrind</code> with the flags mentioned above.
Here is a snippet of the output that we saw when running <code class="highlighter-rouge">valgrind</code> on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">names9</code>:</p>

<p>There can be <em>a lot</em> of output but we know from all of our experience as debuggers at this point that we should begin fixing errors starting with the first one reported—this is the best place to start and, in many cases, will fix a lot of the subsequent messages as well.
The first bit of feedback that <code class="highlighter-rouge">valgrind</code> gave us says that “64 bytes in 4 blocks are indirectly lost…” Which routines are identified as possible sources of memory leakage?
Which of these routines actually allocate memory that was apparently leaked?
How can this be fixed?</p>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong> There exists a comment in the code that identifies where we were a bit “lazy.” What needs to be done for the code to be less lazy?</p>

<p>With the fix in place, let’s re-run <code class="highlighter-rouge">valgrind</code>:</p>

<p>Look at that! No more errors!</p>

<h2 id="activity---try-it">Activity - try it!</h2>

<p>At the end of the day <code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">valgrind</code> are tools that you can choose to use or not (though your grader will likely use both to explore the correctness of your programs so you should too!).
Reading about great tools is one thing, but really learning how to use a tool comes from…
using a tool!
Below are some instructions to get you setup with a few programs that have some bugs—some obvious, and some not so obvious—and your goal is to find those bugs and squash ‘em using <code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code> and/or <code class="highlighter-rouge">valgrind</code>.
Good luck!</p>

<p>In today’s <a href="activity.html">activity</a> we use gdb to explore and fix logic and memory bugs in code.
In your section meeting this week you’ll use gdb and valgrind to practice more logic and memory debugging.</p>
